Introduction
============
Machine learning has gone from the realm of a relatively small number of data scientists to the mainstream of analysis and business. Machine learning proves relevant to a large variety of businesses and is capable of solving highly important business problems including price prediction, fraud detection, or even face recognition. Despite the high demand, the number of companies that have the capability for machine learning/deep learning is still very limited, both in terms of expertise and infrastructure, especially small businesses, such as startups or non-technology companies with a staff of fewer than 50 employees. This is especially accentuated in regions with "sub-developed" Venture Capitalist-equivalent infrastructure or sectors with a low private investment such as agriculture.

Our product aims to make machine learning feasible and affordable for users who have no technical expertise, whether for small business or personal fulfillment. We provide a web application for users to apply machine learning to solve their problems efficiently. The users just need to follow the step-by-step guidance we provide, and a model is trained and be ready to be used shortly without wasting a huge amount of money or time. We call our service an AIaaS (Artificial Intelligence as a Service) product. In the very first phase, we will focus on providing computer vision solutions. Our customers can upload their data to our application and obtain a trained deep learning model for their business problem.
